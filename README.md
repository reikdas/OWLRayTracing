# General-Purpose Computation on RT Cores

<!--- ------------------------------------------------------- -->
Though the RT cores were built to accelerate ray tracing applications, we show that we can re-structure problems to resemble ray tracing problems that can leverage the hardware acceleration. 

In this repository, we implement a clustering application (DBSCAN) and k-Nearest Neighbor Search application that uses RT acceleration. Please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/vani-nag/OWLRayTracing#building-owl--supported-platforms) to install and configure OWL.

<!-- ### RT-DBSCAN 
RT-DBSCAN offloads distance computations in DBSCAN to the ray tracing cores and performs other clustering operations in shader cores. The implementation and execution instructions are in the [RT-DBSCAN](https://github.com/vani-nag/OWLRayTracing/tree/master/samples/s02-rtdbscan) directory. -->

### TrueKNN 
TrueKNN removes the fixed-radius constraint in existing translations of Nearest Neighbor queries to Ray Tracing queries. The implementation and execution instructions are in the [TrueKNN](https://github.com/vani-nag/OWLRayTracing/tree/master/samples/s01-trueknn) directory.

# Building OWL / Supported Platforms

General Requirements:
- OptiX 7 SDK (version 7.0, 7.1, or 7.2, will work with either)
- CUDA verion 10 or 11
- a C++11 capable compiler (regular gcc on CentOS and Linux should do, VS on Windows)

Per-OS Instructions:

- Ubuntu 18, 19, and 20 (automatically tested on 18, mostly developed on 20)
    - Requires: `sudo apt install cmake-curses-gui`
	- Build:
	```
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	```
- CentOS 7:
    - Requires: `sudo yum install cmake3`
	- Build:
	```
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake3 ..
	make
	```
	(mind to use `cmake3`, not `cmake`, using the wrong one will mess up the build directory)

  In case of errors:

    - Make sure that the cuda binary and library are included in $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
    ```
    export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    ```

  - Set the OptiX_INSTALL_DIR to point to the installation of the Optix SDK
   ```
    export OptiX_INSTALL_DIR=/..../NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.2.0-linux64-x86_64
    ```

  - Modify Line 54 of [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/vani-nag/OWLRayTracing/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) to 
  `set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "--std=c++11 -pthread")`. Note the inclusion of `-pthread`.
- Windows
    - Requires: Visual Studio (both 2017 and 2019 work), OptiX 7.0, cmake
	- Build: Use CMake-GUI to build Visual Studio project, then use VS to build
		- Specifics: source code path is ```...Gitlab/owl```, binaries ```...Gitlab/owl/build```, and after pushing the Configure button choose ```x64``` for the optional platform.
		- You may need to Configure twice.
		- If you get "OptiX headers (optix.h and friends) not found." then define OptiX_INCLUDE manually in CMake-gui by setting it to ```C:/ProgramData/NVIDIA Corporation/OptiX SDK 7.0.0/include```

# Using OWL through CMake

Though you can of course use OWL without CMake, it is highly encouraged
to use OWL as a git submodule, using CMake to configure and build this
submodule. In particular, the suggested procedure is to first
do a `add_subdirectory` with the owl submodules as such:

    set(owl_dir ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/whereeverYourOWLSubmoduleIs)
    add_subdirectory(${owl_dir} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

(the `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` makes sure that your main project won't
automatically build any owl samples or test cases unless you explicitly request so).

After that `include_subdirectory` OWL sets some CMake variables in the
parent script that let this parent CMakeList file use it as if it had been
found with a `find_package` script. In particular, it will set the following variables for the user's convenience:

- `OWL_INCLUDES`: the list of directories where owl-related includes
  (like `owl/owl.h' etc) can be found.

- `OWL_CXX_FLAGS`: command-line parameters that the app should pass as
  `compile_definitions` to any source file that includes any owl
  header files. 

- `OWL_LIBRARIES`: the list of libraries the user should link to when
  using OWL.  This will, for example, automatically include TBB
  dependencies if those could be found.
  
- `OWL_VIEWER_LIBRARIES`: libraries required when (also) using the OWL
  sampler viewer widget (programs that use their own viewer/windowing
  code can ignore this).
  
For sample code on how to use this, have a look at the `owl/samples/`
directory.
